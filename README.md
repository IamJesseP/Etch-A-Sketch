# Etch-a-Sketch
Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) Cirriculum

A live preview of my project is [here](https://iamjessep.github.io/EtchSketch/)

### Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JS

### Tools
* VS Code
* Linux terminal
* Git and GitHub
* ESLint

### Functionality

* Clicking inside the grid will toggle the paint function, which depending on the mode toggled, will shade or fill in the cell when the mouse pointer leaves
* You can toggle different grid sizes from 16, 32, and 48
* Added a shake functionality, which mimics an etch-a-sketch in real life and clears the grid

### What I learned

* Solidifed **Javascript concepts**, such as DOM manipulation and event listeners
* Improved **functionality** concepts (optimized and reusable functions)
* Improved use of **HTML5, CSS3 grid/flex**
* Improved understanding code structure and readability
